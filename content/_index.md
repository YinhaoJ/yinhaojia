        I'm a PhD Candidates at Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Florida. My reasearch focus on utilize Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to improve the stability of proteins for therapeutic applications. My research interest span from protein unfolding, protein-protein interactions (PPIs), protein-polymer interactions, and free energy calculation (Metadynamics).

        I apply a range of MD simulation methods to investigate the properties of soft materials, giving microscopic and mechanistic insights for material design and pushing the boundary.
