abstract: This study investigates the phase transition of globular protein vesicles
  -- a model for protein-constructed artificial cells and organelles -- under macromolecular
  crowding conditions in biomimetic environments.           ,              Artificial
  cells, synthetic analogues of living cells in both structure and function, have
  emerged as valuable tools for investigating the principles of life and for advanced
  applications. These artificial cells are constructed through the self-assembly of
  biological molecules and have been examined under macromolecularly crowded conditions.
  The dense environment of the intracellular cytoplasm or extracellular matrix is
  recapitulated by using macromolecules such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), with concentrations
  that typically range from 10 to 40% w/v. We investigate the self-assembly of recombinant
  fusion proteins composed of functionally folded globular protein and elastin-like
  polypeptide (ELP) into coacervates or vesicles to develop a potential artificial
  cell platform. Herein, we focus on understanding the phase transition of the recombinant
  fusion protein assemblies and vesicles in PEG-rich, macromolecularly crowded conditions
  by experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. It has been found that self-assembled
  protein vesicles undergo agglomeration in macromolecularly crowded conditions, where
  individual vesicles cluster to form larger aggregates. This is followed by the vesicle-to-coacervate
  transition and phase separation in the protein-rich particles. The PEG concentrations
  that induce the phase transition of the protein assemblies depend on the relative
  number of globular proteins at vesicle surfaces. This knowledge would be useful
  to provide engineering strategies for artificial cells in cell-like macromolecularly
  crowded conditions.
