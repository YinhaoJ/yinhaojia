 abstract = {Biologic drugs or ``biologics'' (proteins derived from living organisms) are one of the fastest-growing classes of FDA-approved therapeutics. These compounds are often fragile and require conjugation to polymers for stabilization, with many proteins too ephemeral for therapeutic use. During storage or administration, proteins tend to unravel and lose their secondary structure due to changes in solution temperature, pH, and other external stressors. To enhance their lifetime, protein drugs currently in the market are conjugated with polyethylene glycol (PEG), owing to its ability to increase the stability, solubility, and pharmacokinetics of protein drugs. Here, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to study the unfolding process of egg-white lysozyme and insulin at elevated temperatures. We test the validity of two force fields-CHARMM36 and Amber ff99SB-ILDN-in the unfolding process. By calculating global and local properties, we capture residues that deteriorate first-these are the ``weak links'' in},
