  abstract = {Biologic drugs or “biologics” (proteins derived from living organisms) are one of the fastest-growing classes of FDA-approved therapeutics. These compounds are often fragile and require conjugation to polymers for stabilization, with many proteins too ephemeral for therapeutic use. During storage or administration, proteins tend to unravel and lose their secondary structure due to changes in solution temperature, pH, and other external stressors. To enhance their lifetime, protein drugs currently in the market are conjugated with polyethylene glycol (PEG), owing to its ability to increase the stability, solubility, and pharmacokinetics of protein drugs. Here, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to study the unfolding process of egg-white lysozyme and insulin at elevated temperatures. We test the validity of two force fields─CHARMM36 and Amber ff99SB-ILDN─in the unfolding process. By calculating global and local properties, we capture residues that deteriorate first─these are the “weak links” in},

  abstract = {This study investigates the phase transition of globular protein vesicles – a model for protein-constructed artificial cells and organelles – under macromolecular crowding conditions in biomimetic environments.           ,              Artificial cells, synthetic analogues of living cells in both structure and function, have emerged as valuable tools for investigating the principles of life and for advanced applications. These artificial cells are constructed through the self-assembly of biological molecules and have been examined under macromolecularly crowded conditions. The dense environment of the intracellular cytoplasm or extracellular matrix is recapitulated by using macromolecules such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), with concentrations that typically range from 10 to 40\% w/v. We investigate the self-assembly of recombinant fusion proteins composed of functionally folded globular protein and elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) into coacervates or vesicles to develop a potential artificial cell platform. Herein, we focus on understanding the phase transition of the recombinant fusion protein assemblies and vesicles in PEG-rich, macromolecularly crowded conditions by experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. It has been found that self-assembled protein vesicles undergo agglomeration in macromolecularly crowded conditions, where individual vesicles cluster to form larger aggregates. This is followed by the vesicle-to-coacervate transition and phase separation in the protein-rich particles. The PEG concentrations that induce the phase transition of the protein assemblies depend on the relative number of globular proteins at vesicle surfaces. This knowledge would be useful to provide engineering strategies for artificial cells in cell-like macromolecularly crowded conditions.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Sponge‐like materials made from regenerated silk fibroin biopolymers are a tunable and advantageous platform for in vitro engineered tissue culture and in vivo tissue regeneration. Anisotropic, three‐dimensional (3D) silk fibroin sponge‐like scaffolds can mimic the architecture of contractile muscle. Herein, we use silk fibroin solution isolated from the cocoons of               Bombyx mori               silkworms to form aligned sponges via directional ice templating in a custom mold with a slurry of dry ice and ethanol. Hydrated tensile mechanical properties of these aligned sponges were evaluated as a function of silk polymer concentration (3\% or 5\%), freezing time (50\% or 100\% ethanol), and post‐lyophilization method for inducing crystallinity (autoclaving, water annealing). Hydrated static tensile tests were used to determine Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength across sponge formulations at two strain rates to evaluate rate dependence in the calculated parameters. Results aligned with previous reports in the literature for isotropic silk fibroin sponge‐like scaffolds, where the method by which beta‐sheets were formed and level of beta‐sheet content (crystallinity) had the greatest impact on static parameters, while polymer concentration and freezing rate did not significantly impact static mechanical properties. We estimated the crystalline organization using molecular dynamics simulations to show that larger crystalline regions may be responsible for strength at low strain amplitudes and brittleness at high strain amplitudes in the autoclaved sponges. Within the parameters evaluated, extensional Young's modulus is tunable in the range of 600–2800\,kPa. Dynamic tensile testing revealed the linear viscoelastic region to be between 0\% and 10\% strain amplitude and 0.2–2\,Hz frequencies. Long‐term stability was evaluated by hysteresis and fatigue tests. Fatigue tests showed minimal change in the storage and loss modulus of 5\% silk fibroin sponges for more than 6000\,min of continuous mechanical stimulation in the linear regime at 10\% strain amplitude and 1\,Hz frequency. Furthermore, we confirmed that these mechanical properties hold when decellularized extracellular matrix is added to the sponges and when the mechanical property assessments were performed in cell culture media. We also used nano‐computed tomography (nano‐CT) and simulations to explore pore interconnectivity and tortuosity. Overall, these results highlight the potential of anisotropic, sponge‐like silk fibroin scaffolds for long‐term ({$>$}6\,weeks) contractile muscle culture with an in vitro bioreactor system that provides routine mechanical stimulation.},
